# Purpose

- Sensitive information, such as passwords and API keys, cannot go into your repository, or be present anywhere in your codebase, since this would be a major security hazard.
- This is also a good way to set various configuration options for your application. For example, if you had a "debug" mode that printed out extra logs and a "production" mode that compressed your code, you would set that here.
