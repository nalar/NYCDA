# Summary

- A block of code that is packaged together and can be repeatedly used when needed. 
- Functions allow the developer to write some code once, place it inside a function, then call that function any time they want to run that code.

# Explanation

- To define a function, use the keyword *function*, followed by the name of the function and parentheses. Curly braces contain the body of the function.
- When the function is invoked or called, the body is executed.
- Once the body has finished executing, the function returns to the location where it was called from.

---

# Function Parameters
- Functions can in inputs, which are called parameters or arguments.
- These values are passed in when the function is called, and are used in the function body.
- Parameters are substituted into the function in order. 

---

# Return values
- Functions, when they are finished executing, can optionally return a value using the *return* keyword.
