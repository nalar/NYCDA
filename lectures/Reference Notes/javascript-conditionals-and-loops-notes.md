# Reference Notes

---

# Summary: Conditionals
- Conditional statements allow different things to happen given different circumstances
- This means your program, instead of executing one line after another, can behave differently, given different inputs

---

# Examples: Conditionals
- Given user input, such as clicking different buttons on a screen, react differently to each key press
- Given several different types of data, process each one appropriately

---

# Summary: Loops
- Allows your program to execute a given block of code repeatedly until a constraint is met
- Loops are used any time you need your program to do something more than once

---

# Examples: Loops
- Processing the value of each pixel and sending it to the screen
- Having several files that need to be read, and reading each one
