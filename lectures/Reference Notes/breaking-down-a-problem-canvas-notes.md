# Breaking Down a Problem
- Early computer art
[http://digitalartmuseum.org/noll/artworks_01.html](http://digitalartmuseum.org/noll/artworks_01.html)

---

# The Different Parts of the Problem
- 90 lines
- each line seems to be kind of a sine wave
- each line's wave frequency decreases as it goes to the right
- each line seems to be made of little line segments

---

# The Code
- Without understanding what any of this means, we can take educated guesses about what is happening
- The `createWave` function creates a line
- The `for` thing makes it repeat 
- `context.lineTo(x, y)` creates a line segment. `x` and `y` are determined with the math above it

---

# Expectations
- In the coming few weeks, we're going to learn about each thing that's happening here.
- Each of the concepts used in creating this piece of computer art necessary to become a proficient programmer.
