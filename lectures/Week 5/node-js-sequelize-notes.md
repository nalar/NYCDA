# Reference Notes

---

# Recommended reading (estimated time: 4 hours):
- Try the example code at: http://sequelize.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
- Clicking `next` will take you on a tour of the module, along with its core features.

---

# Promise.all
- takes in an array of Promises
- `resolves` when each of the Promises are resolved or `rejects` when one of the Promises is rejected
- good when several preconditions need to be met to continue, but those conditions do not rely on each other.
